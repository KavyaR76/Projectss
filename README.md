By applying Excel-based techniques, we identify high-growth opportunities and provide data-backed recommendations for business expansion and customer retention.

## 🧩 Objectives

- Identify high-potential cities and cuisines for restaurant growth.
- Analyze customer behavior through ratings, cost, and services like delivery or booking.
- Guide strategic onboarding of new restaurant partners based on market trends.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- Microsoft Excel (no external tools used)
- Data Cleaning (removal of duplicates, correction of invalid values, standardization)
- Functions Used: `IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGEIF`, `CONCATENATE`, `CORREL`, `DATE`etc.
- Pivot Tables for aggregating KPIs
- Charts: Column, Bar, Pie, and Line Charts for visualization
- Conditional Formatting for highlighting performance

## 📈 Key Insights

- Mid-range restaurants (₹400–₹700) tend to have higher average ratings and customer engagement.
- North Indian and Chinese cuisines dominate demand in Tier-1 cities.
